# Hi there, I'm Kevin Nguefack

💡 Passionate about AI & IT Project Management

I thrive at the intersection of technology and organization.  
My passion lies in building and testing web applications, especially those powered by artificial intelligence.  

In my daily work, I explore agile methodologies like **Kanban** and **Scrum** to manage projects efficiently and deliver meaningful results.

Always curious, always learning — I enjoy turning ideas into working prototypes and bringing structure to innovation.
